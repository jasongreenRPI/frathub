# Best Practices Documentation

This document outlines how the FratHub project adheres to the required best practices.

## Mandatory Best Practices

### 1. Project Management Web Site

- **Implementation**: The project is hosted on GitHub at [https://github.com/jasongreenRPI/frathub](https://github.com/jasongreenRPI/frathub).
- **Features Used**:
  - Issue tracking for bug reports and feature requests
  - Pull requests for code reviews
  - Branch management for feature development
  - Commit history for tracking changes
  - Project boards for task management

### 2. Project Task Tracking Web Site

- **Implementation**: The project uses GitHub Projects for task tracking.
- **Features Used**:
  - Kanban board for visualizing workflow
  - Task assignment to team members
  - Due dates and milestones
  - Labels for categorizing tasks
  - Integration with GitHub Issues

### 3. Code Repository

- **Implementation**: Git is used as the version control system, hosted on GitHub.
- **Features Used**:
  - Authentication for security
  - Branch management for parallel development
  - Pull requests for code reviews
  - Commit history for tracking changes
  - Merge functionality for integrating changes

### 4. Documented Coding Standards

- **Implementation**: ESLint is configured in `.eslintrc.json` to enforce coding standards.
- **Standards Adopted**:
  - 2-space indentation
  - Unix line endings
  - Single quotes for strings
  - Semicolons required
  - ECMAScript 2020 features
  - Node.js environment

### 5. Object-Oriented Design

- **Implementation**: The project is built using object-oriented principles.
- **Concepts Used**:
  - **Encapsulation**: Data and methods are encapsulated within classes and modules
  - **Inheritance**: Models extend base classes for common functionality
  - **Polymorphism**: Interfaces are used for flexible implementations
  - **Abstraction**: Complex operations are abstracted into reusable functions

## Additional Best Practices

### 6. Automated Testing

- **Implementation**: Jest is used for backend automated testing, and Flutter's testing framework for frontend.
- **Features**:
  - Unit tests for individual components
  - Integration tests for API endpoints
  - Test coverage reporting
  - Continuous integration testing
  - Test scripts in package.json for different testing scenarios

### 7. Build Tools

- **Implementation**: npm scripts are used for the backend, and Flutter commands for the frontend.
- **Scripts**:
  - Backend:
    - `npm start`: Production server
    - `npm run dev`: Development server with hot reloading
    - `npm test`: Run all tests
    - `npm run test:coverage`: Generate test coverage report
  - Frontend:
    - `flutter run`: Run the app in debug mode
    - `flutter build`: Build the app for production
    - `flutter test`: Run all tests

### 8. Unit Test Tools

- **Implementation**: Jest and Supertest for backend, Flutter's testing framework for frontend.
- **Features**:
  - Test runners for executing tests
  - Assertion library for validating results
  - HTTP client for testing API endpoints
  - Mocking capabilities for isolating components

### 9. Mock Objects in Unit Tests

- **Implementation**: Jest's mocking capabilities for backend, Flutter's mockito for frontend.
- **Usage**:
  - Mocking database connections
  - Mocking external services
  - Mocking authentication
  - Isolating components for testing

### 10. Dependency Injection

- **Implementation**: The project uses dependency injection patterns in both backend and frontend.
- **Usage**:
  - Backend: Injecting database connections, configuration, and services
  - Frontend: Using provider pattern for state management and dependency injection
  - Facilitating testing through dependency injection

### 11. Bug Tracking System

- **Implementation**: GitHub Issues is used for bug tracking.
- **Features**:
  - Bug reporting templates
  - Issue assignment
  - Status tracking
  - Integration with pull requests
  - Labels for categorizing issues

### 12. Linting System

- **Implementation**: ESLint for backend, Flutter's analyzer for frontend.
- **Configuration**:
  - Backend: Custom rules in `.eslintrc.json`
  - Frontend: Analysis options in `analysis_options.yaml`
  - Integration with the build process
  - Automatic fixing of common issues
  - Consistent code style enforcement

### 13. Third-Party Components

- **Implementation**: Several third-party libraries are used.
- **Backend Libraries**:
  - Express.js for the web framework
  - Mongoose for MongoDB ODM
  - JWT for authentication
  - Bcrypt for password hashing
  - Helmet for security headers
  - Compression for response compression
  - CORS for cross-origin resource sharing
  - Morgan for HTTP request logging
- **Frontend Libraries**:
  - Flutter for UI framework
  - Provider for state management
  - HTTP for API communication
  - Shared preferences for local storage
  - Image picker for media selection
  - Intl for internationalization

### 14. Design Patterns

- **Implementation**: Several design patterns are used in the project.
- **Backend Patterns**:
  - **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: Separating data, presentation, and control logic
  - **Repository Pattern**: Abstracting data access
  - **Middleware Pattern**: Processing requests and responses
  - **Factory Pattern**: Creating objects
  - **Singleton Pattern**: Ensuring single instances of resources
  - **Strategy Pattern**: Defining a family of algorithms
- **Frontend Patterns**:
  - **Provider Pattern**: For state management
  - **Builder Pattern**: For UI construction
  - **Factory Pattern**: For creating widgets
  - **Observer Pattern**: For reactive UI updates
  - **Repository Pattern**: For data access
  - **Strategy Pattern**: For interchangeable algorithms
